This `modules.system.layers.base` directory structure is created only to mimic actual base layer in the real distribution.

If not present the Dist-Diff will complain with Error message together with an IllegalStateException that there are no
layers definition in the distribution. We don't want such Error message and exceptions in our tests runs to avoid confusion.
